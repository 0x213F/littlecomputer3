The goal of this project is to make a better learning environment for aspiring computer engineers. http://littlecomputer3.com is an IDE for LC-3 assembly code. Intuitive debugging tools help visualize the data in memory and registers to help understand how computers work without abstraction.

 > Little Computer 3, or LC-3, is a type of computer educational programming language, an assembly language, which is a type of low-level programming language. The LC-3 was developed by Yale N. Patt at the University of Texas at Austin and Sanjay J. Patel at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign. Their specification of the instruction set, the overall architecture of the LC-3, and a hardware implementation can be found in their textbook "Introduction to Computing Systems."

You can write either binary or assembly code and run it directly in your browser. I have built an interpreter and parser in JavaScript; everything is run locally.

Try the sample program by following these simple steps:

* go to [the website](http://littlecomputer3.com)
* click the play button
* click the terminal in the bottom right
* type on the keyboard
* press enter twice to terminate the programming
